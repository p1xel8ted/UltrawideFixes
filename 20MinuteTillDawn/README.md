## Features
- Overrides fullscreen to the main display resolution and enforces the appropriate aspect-ratio.
- Adds all available resolutions to the windowed mode picker.

## Notes
- The Fog of War circle at 21:9 is increased in scale just slightly to fill the edges. At super-wide, there will probably be a gap on the edges of the screen.
- The UI/hud is tied to the aspect ratio, which is fine for 21:9. Anything wider will be like watching the tennis.
