## Features
- Removes pillar boxing. The resolution menu is ignored.
- Corrects scaling of UI elements when using a non-16:9 resolution. The menu is still 16:9 (on purpose).
- Allows the player to expand the UI or leave it at 16:9.
- The main game UI (player hud, health, etc.) can adjust its scale.
- Skip splash screens and the "press any key to start" screen.
