Tested against retail Steam version @ 3440x1440 and 5120x1440.

## Features
- Main display resolution added to the games list of supported resolutions.
- Game over scene is now scaled correctly instead of being stretched. Added a black background to fill the empty space (or you see the menu background).
- Textures that needed it (backgrounds, main menu foreground) are now scaled to fit the screen. This is done equally in both directions to avoid stretching.
- Skip straight to the main menu on game start.
- Achievements stay enabled regardless of difficulty selection.

## Configuration
- None
