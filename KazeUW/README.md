## Features
- Removes pillar boxing when using ultrawide resolutions.
- Skips developer/publisher logos.
- Correct certain UI elements where possible for UW.

## Note
- Doesn't correct certain elements such as loading screens etc. The gameplay is fine.
- Tested at 3440x1440, Steam.

## Installation
- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Kaze and the Wild Masks**" for Steam).
- The first run after installing BepInEx may take a little longer than usual due to the IL2CPP processing that occurs on the first run.
