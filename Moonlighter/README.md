## Features

- Makes your main display resolution the only one available.
- Selectable display (main, secondary etc.)
- Corrects dungeon artwork - mostly. It will look average on anything wider than 21:9.

## Configuration
- Manually edit the configuration file that was created after the first launch:
- `...\steamapps\common\Moonlighter\BepInEx\config\p1xel8ted.moonlighter.ultrawide.cfg`
- Restart after changes.

## Installation
- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Moonlighter**" for Steam).
