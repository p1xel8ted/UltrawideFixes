## Features
- Allows selection of main display resolution in the in-game resolution list.
- Removes pillarboxing.
- Skips intros.
- Adjust dialog scale.

## Note
- Doesn't scale loading screens/main menu. Game play is fine.
- Background sprites are cooked. Dunno how to fix. Feel free.

## Installation
- Grab the latest release of Alwa's Legacy Ultra-wide Fix from [here.](https://github.com/p1xel8ted/AlwasLegacy/releases)
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Alwa's Legacy**" for Steam).

## Configuration
- HorizontalScrollAdjustment = Change when the game initiates a scroll. The current setting will scroll when the player is within 300 pixels of the left/right edge of the screen. This setting allows you to adjust that value.
- DialogScale = Scale of the NPC dialogues and item pickup dialogues. 0.75 is the default (makes it a littler smaller).
