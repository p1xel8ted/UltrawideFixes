Not really an ultra-wide fix as the game appears to be fine (at 21:9) if you don't touch the resolution toggle. This is more of a QoL tweak to make the game run a little smoother.

## Features
- Adds main display resolution to the resolution menu in-game. Because it irks me that it's not there.
- Corrects the camera update rate to a) the minimum to prevent judder or b) your refresh rate, for a little more smoothness
- Adjusts target framerate to display refresh rate

## Installation
- Grab the latest release from [here](https://github.com/p1xel8ted/UltrawideFixes/releases/tag/Cuisineer).
- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory.<br />(e.g. `**steamapps\common\Cuisineer**` for Steam).
