Developed against the Steam version @ 3440x1440

## Features
- Forces main display resolution. Select display in config file.
- Option to keep HUD at 16:9 positions instead of expanding.
- Map is restricted to 16:9 intentionally.
- Option to correct the main menu backgrounds etc. Looks fine on 21:9.
- Various UI components have been manually adjusted for the wider aspect.
- Added 'Quit to Desktop' button to the in-game menu.

## Note
- The UI is not designed for the English language; many components (such as text) are not aligned correctly/overlap. This is not the mod.
- I've manually corrected these instances where possible.

## Configuration
- The settings file can be found in `BepInEx/config/p1xel8ted.herosadventureroadtopassion.ultrawide.cfg`.
