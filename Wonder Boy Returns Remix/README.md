Tested against retail Steam version @ 3440x1440.

## ðŸš© Notes
- This game has really janky resolution control. I've forced it at an engine level and a game level, but it stil renders at 1920x1080 (you can verify in SpecialK); but the aspect is still correct...
- If you force the resolution to your native resolution using SpecialK, the game black screens.

## Features
- Overrides full screen to the main display resolution and enforces the appropriate aspect ratio.
- UI corrections, mostly related to the main menu, and character/level select screens.
- Control camera zoom.
