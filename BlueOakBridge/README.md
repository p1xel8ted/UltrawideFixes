# Blue Oak Bridge

![header](https://github.com/p1xel8ted/UltrawideFixes/assets/10510767/310f14f1-3a68-425e-ac22-d30fbaf7707b)

Tested against retail Steam version @ 3440x1440.

## Features
- Overrides resolution and refresh rate to that of whichever display you have set in the configuration.
- Control fullscreen modes; defaults to Fullscreen Window.
- Override the physics update rate to a multiple of your refresh rate to fix the awful camera judder (it's hardcoded to 50Hz by default). Be careful going too high if you play the game on a potato.
- Change the scale of the UI.
- Menu background image is corrected based on 21:9 or 32:9. No action taken if less than 21:9.
- Control zoom levels, as the default is clearly designed for TV use.
