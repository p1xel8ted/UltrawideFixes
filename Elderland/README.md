# Elderland

![header](https://github.com/p1xel8ted/UltrawideFixes/assets/10510767/5d719f40-ee32-40fd-b1a8-c855f1c2f237)

Tested against retail Steam version @ 3440x1440.

## ðŸš© Note
- There are maps that have no extension beyond 16:9, meaning there just isn't any content to fill the sides. Sometimes despite there being black bars, there is still content there I can work with to fill the gap - not this time.

## Features
- Main display resolution added to the in-game list. Valid aspects expanded to whatever your displays is.
- Pillar-boxing removed and UI scaling corrected.
- Option to either expand the HUD or keep it centered.
- Option to change the camera zoom.
- Option to change Mute in Background & Run in Background behaviour.
