# Nier Replicant Ultrawide & Performance Mod Guide

Enhance your Nier Replicant experience with ultrawide support and improved game performance. Follow the steps below to apply the necessary mods.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have administrative access to your game's installation directory, typically located in your Steam or game library folder.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Apply the Ultrawide Patch

1. Visit the [Nier Replicant Ultrawide Patcher GitHub page](https://github.com/PineappleIOnic/Nier-Replicant-Ultrawide-Patcher/).
2. Download and run the patcher, selecting your monitor's aspect ratio when prompted to adjust the game to your display.

### Step 2: Set Up Special K

1. Download the latest version of Special K from [Special K's website](https://www.special-k.info/).
2. Locate the `SpecialK64.dll` file in your download, rename it to `dxgi.dll`, and move it to your game's main installation folder.

### Step 3: Use Replicant's Little Helper

1. Download Replicant's Little Helper from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/nierreplicant/mods/12?tab=files).
2. Extract all the files directly into the game's installation folder, overwriting files when prompted.
3. Find and open `custom_dxgi.ini`, copy all its contents.
4. Open `dxgi.ini` in the same directory, paste the copied contents into it, then delete `custom_dxgi.ini`.

### Step 4: Access Special K Menu

- In-game, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Backspace` to open the Special K menu.
- Enable the "High FPS Fix" from the menu and adjust any other settings to your preference.

## Verifying the Installation

After completing the above steps, launch Nier Replicant. The game should now run with ultrawide support, and you'll potentially notice improved performance. The main game UI will remain at a 16:9 aspect ratio, but the gameplay will be adapted to your ultrawide screen.
