## Note

- Tested on both versions of the game (Steam).

## Features (all configurable)
### Ultra-wide
- Allows selection of ultra-wide display resolutions in the in-game resolution list.
- Removes pillarboxing when ultra-wide is being used.
- Scales background images where possible. Looks fine on 21:9, will look average on anything wider.
- Change scaling behaviour of the UI, it may make it worse than the original, see how you go.
- For when the above is no good, try using Manual Scale mode. Adjust the slider to manually adjust.

#### * Note on change scale/ultra-wide settings - it's recommended to restart the game after changing any of these settings.

### Zoom
- When enabled, zoom in level is adjusted to allow zooming in more, and the maximum zoom-out can be manually configured. The games default is 10. Setting it too high will make unrendered areas visible.
### Misc
- Stop trees going transparent when you're behind them or the camera is close to them.
- Automatically trigger chest's opening when the dialog box appears.
### Sound (these are largely personal preference)
#### Move the slider left for lower volume, move it to the right for higher volume. Setting it to 0 is no change from original volume.
- Adjust the volume of the voice over when the character levels (or turn off entirely).
- Adjust the volume of crystal collection sounds (or turn off entirely).
- Adjust the volume of the sunstone ability.

## Note
- Comes bundled with ConfigurationManager allowing you to press F1 and change mod settings in-game.
