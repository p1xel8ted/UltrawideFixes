## Note

- Tested on both versions of the game (Steam).

## Features (all configurable)
### Ultra-wide
- Allows selection of ultra-wide display resolutions in the in-game resolution list.
- Removes pillar boxing when ultra-wide is being used.
- Scales background images where possible. Looks fine on 21:9 but will look average on anything wider.
- Change the scaling behaviour of the UI; it may make it worse than the original; see how you go.
- When the above is no good, try using Manual Scale mode. Adjust the slider to adjust manually.

#### * Note on change scale/ultra-wide settings - it's recommended to restart the game after changing any of these settings.

### Zoom
- When enabled, the zoom-in level is adjusted to allow zooming in more, and the maximum zoom-out can be manually configured. The game's default is 10. Setting it too high will make unrendered areas visible.
### Misc
- Stop trees going transparent when you're behind them, or the camera is close to them.
- Automatically trigger the chest's opening when the dialogue box appears.
### Sound (these are largely personal preference)
#### Move the slider left for lower volume, and move it to the right for higher volume. Setting it to 0 is no change from the original volume.
- Adjust the voiceover volume when the character levels (or turn off entirely).
- Adjust the volume of crystal collection sounds (or turn off entirely).
- Adjust the volume of the sunstone ability.

## Note
- Comes bundled with ConfigurationManager allowing you to press F1 and change mod settings in-game.

## Installation
- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\Beautiful Mystic Survivors**" or "**steamapps\common\Sexy Mystic Survivors**" for Steam).
