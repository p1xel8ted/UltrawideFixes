## Features
- Pillar boxing removed.
- UI remains at 16:9 and centered.
- Removes the cropping on the left and right sides of the screen.
- Viewport adjustable to find a balance between view and the map tiles spawning/despawning on the edges of the screen.
- Press F1 to open the config screen and set as desired.

## Notes
- This is for the version that has ModIO support. I'm working on attempting to get adjust when the game decides to remove tile it thinks are out of view, but I can't promise anything.

## Menu (F1)
(The menu has some quirks; grabbing the mouse works best when paused.)
