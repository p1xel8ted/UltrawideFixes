### CoreKeeper Ultra-wide Fix

![Game Logo](header.jpg)<br>

## Features

- Removes pillar boxing in the menus.
- Expands viewport width. Note you will see world spawn/de-spawning near the edges of the screen. It will most likely be worse the wider the aspect ratio.
- The viewport width is adjusted automatically, but a custom width can be set.
- Press F1 to bring up the configuration window in the game. It is only needed if you want to change the width manually - it defaults to your aspect ratio.

(The menu has some quirks; grabbing the mouse works best when paused.)

## Notes

- This uses a custom build of BepInEx from [here](https://core-keeper.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Core_Keeper/) should it need updating in the future.
- The game is also an IL2CPP game, so the first start (and after any game updates) will be a little longer while it generates assemblies.

## Installation
- Install using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/Thunderstore_Mod_Manager/).

## Manual Installation
- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**steamapps\common\CoreKeeper**" for Steam).
