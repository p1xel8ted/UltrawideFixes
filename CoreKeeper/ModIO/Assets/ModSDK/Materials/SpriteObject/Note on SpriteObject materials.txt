-- NOTE ON SPRITE OBJECT MATERIALS --

SpriteObjects are special renderers that are gathered in big lists and drawn together in very few draw calls.
This makes them very efficient, but also means they are not sorted in any way before being drawn.
Because of this, they only support opaque (non-transparent/seethrough) or certain special (ground shadow + indirect light) sprites.
If you need to implement transparent effects, use the regular materials.

Note that these materials simply act as dummy materials for previewing user-generated content. During runtime they are swapped out for actual game materials.
As such, if you make changes to the material/shader it will not carry over to the game. You should also avoid moving and/or deleting these materials.
