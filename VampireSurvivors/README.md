## New Engine Only

* You must be using the 'newengine' branch of the game. Not compatible with the original version.

## Features

* Forces the aspect ratio to your current main display, removing the black bars.
* Tested on 3440x1440 Steam.

## Installation

- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory. (e.g. "**steamapps\common\Vampire Survivors**" for Steam).
- Run 'MelonLoader.Installer.exe'.
- Choose the Settings tab and enable 'Show Alpha Pre-Releases.'
- Choose the Automated tab and select version 0.6.1 from the drop-down.
- Leave Game Arch on Auto.
- Click Install

## Known Issues

- **The 'challenge' levels have issues where the ground tileset stops rendering outside of 16:9. Those levels have been implemented differently compared to the others. No fix at this stage.**
- Enemies pop in where the black bars would normally be.
- Not a mod issue, but the game appears zoomed in compared to the original engine.

## Notes

- The game's first run will take a little longer while Melon Loader works its magic, but this only happens once (or on game updates).
