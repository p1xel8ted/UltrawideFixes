## New Engine Only

* You must be using the 'newengine' branch of the game. Not compatible with the original version.

## Features

* Forces the aspect ratio to your current main display, removing the black bars.
* Tested on 3440x1440 Steam.

## Installation

- Extract the contents of the release zip into the game directory. (e.g. "**steamapps\common\Vampire Survivors**" for Steam).
- Run 'MelonLoader.Installer.exe'.
- Click 'Select' next to Unity Game and navigate to the game directory, selecting 'Vampire Survivors.exe'.
- Choose the Automated tab and select version 0.6.1 from the drop-down.
- Leave Game Arch on Auto.
- Click Install

## Notes

- I've removed the Expand UI option.
- The game's first run will take a little longer while Melon Loader works its magic, but this only happens once (or on game updates).
- This may break on updates.
